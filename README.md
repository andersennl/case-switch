# case-switch package for Atom editor

Atom editor package to change variable/method names from hyphen- to snake- to camelCase and back again.

# Functionality
## Direct conversion
You can use (and bind) the following switches to directly change the case of a selected text.
* hypen-case to snake_case
* hypen-case to camelCase
* snake_case to hypen-case
* snake_case to camelCase
* camelCase to hypen-case
* camelCase to snake_case
I didn't add default keybindings as there are just too many direct commands.

## Toggling through cases
You can toggle through the cases for a selected text.
(Default: `alt-cmd-c` on OS X)

# Roadmap
* convert multiple selections at once
