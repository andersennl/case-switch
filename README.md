# case-switch package

Atom editor package to change variable names from hyphen- to snake- to camelCase.

### This version currently supports conversion from
* hypen-case to snake_case
* snake_case to camelCase

You can easily toggle through them with the `toggle` command or
use direct conversion by specific commands from the command palette.

### Coming soon: camelCase to hypen-case conversion.
