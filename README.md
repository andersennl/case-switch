# Case Switch package for Atom editor

Atom editor package to change variable/method names from kebab- to snake- to camelCase and back again.

# Functionality
There are two ways to convert your selected text.

## Direct conversion
By using the methods below, you let Atom detect what type-case your currently selected text has. You just have to choose what case you want the text to be.

* `alt-c ctrl-c` switches selected text to camelCase
* `alt-c ctrl-s` switches selected text to snake_case
* `alt-c ctrl-k` switches selected text to kebab-case

## Toggling through cases
Easily toggle through the cases for a selected text. This is probably the most useful command. *currently the text isn't selected anymore after switching - this will be fixed soon.*

(Default: `alt-c ctrl-t` on OS X)

# Roadmap
* fix toggle function loosing selection
